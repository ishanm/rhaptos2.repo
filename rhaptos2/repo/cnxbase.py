"""THis exists solely to provide less typing for a "leaf node" in a
simple realtional schema (1:M and 1:M-N:1) when used with SQLAlchemy

SA does not support class based inheritence in the normal Python way
for objects inheriting from Base.  Thus we have those objects perform
multiple inheritence...

security issues

Discussion

I see each resource (folder, module, collection) as a individual resource
with individually managed permissions.

Each function (GET PUT POST DELETE) should be requested through the API with
a security "thing" (useruri).  This is to try and keep stateless end to end
(ie not have to worry how we are handling sessions from the request point through the
backend)



Security use cases

folder

1. User has RW permission set on Folder F and children C1,C2

        form.  There are two types we *shall* support.  softform and hardform
        A resource only contains links (pointers) to other resources - so
        a container-type resource (folder, collection) will hold links only
        such as
         body = ["/folder/1234", "/module/5678"]

        However if we returned that resource to the client, it would then need
        to perform *n* more requests to get the title of each.

        To avoid this we return a softform
        
         body = [{'id': '/folder/1234', 'title': 'foo', 'mediatype':'application/vnd.org.cnx.folder'},
                 {'id': '/module/5678', 'title': 'bar', 'mediatype':'application/vnd.org.cnx.module'},

        This however needs us to descend into the container, and requiores a security check at each
        resource.  It also requires a flag for whih form.

        At the moment only folder has any need for a softform approach and it is the default here

           its own hierarchy and produce short-form versions of its children
           And a short-form long-form approach that needs to produce either the whole object
           or just a few items (title, id etc)
